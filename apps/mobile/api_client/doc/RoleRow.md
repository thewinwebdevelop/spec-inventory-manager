## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** |  | 
**name** | **String** | Display name. F-003 lets people rename roles, so do NOT map this to Thai copy — use `key`, and fall back to this string.  | 
**key** | **String** | Stable slug for TRANSLATION ONLY (ux Q4). Guaranteed `owner`, `admin` or `staff` for the three system roles — those values are part of the contract and changing one is a breaking change. `null` for any role F-003 lets a user create, because `key` is the system's namespace.  OPEN SET: on `null` or an unrecognised value the client MUST fall back to `name`. Never `switch` without a default.  ⛔ NEVER a permission input, on either side. \"Is this the Owner?\" is answered by capabilities alone (architecture §3.2 / data-model §5.2); @qa's I-45 flips a Staff role's `key` to `\"owner\"` in the database to prove a client that trusted it would be wrong.  | 
**isSystem** | **bool** | True for roles the system provisions with the shop. F-003 will refuse to delete these.  |
